<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 4.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; font: 18.7px Times New Roman"><b><i>Objective:</i></b></h2>
<p class="p3">This assignment helps students to understand the effects of development on traffic and how to test network alternatives using travel demand models. Students will be policy makers and decide how to adapt the traffic network to the increasing development of a city. The analysis will be based on the agent-based travel demand model (ADAM), an on-line simulator. Students have to justify their development choices using criteria and indicators from simulation study.</p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 4.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; font: 18.7px Times New Roman"><b><i>Instructions:</i></b></h2>
<p class="p3">We use the Sioux Falls network as the background. After checking the current demand on the network, we may conclude that new expansions are needed to mitigate the congestion on current network. For traffic engineers and planners, the question would be where to invest our money to achieve the best outcomes.</p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p4">The construction of new links introduces extra cost. As a policy maker of the city, you are supposed to decide the network growth pattern and expand current links to serve the increasing demand. The construction cost for each lane per km is 3 million dollars. The total budget allocated for this project is $15,000,000 (5lane-km). Your objective is to improve the network and justify your choices using concepts learned in CE3201.</p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3">In this study, the global variables are fixed. Travel demand is given by exogenous planning data and is supposed to remain constant during this time period. However, expansions of any particular link will change the flow pattern on the network and may indirectly influence the flow on other links. Therefore, your criteria of investment should be network-wide. Examples of such criteria includes total vehicle hours traveled (vht), maximum volume-capacity ratio, consumer-surplus, and benefit-cost ratio. You only need to use one of criterion above.</p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 4.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; font: 18.7px Times New Roman"><b><i>Tasks:</i></b></h2>
<ol>
  <li style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; font: 16.0px Times New Roman">Starting from the Sioux Falls network, learn the current travel demand and corresponding flow pattern on the network by checking the statistics option or the interactive use interface in ADAM. Identify the most congested link (with the highest volume/capacity ratio).</li>
  <li style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; font: 14.0px Times New Roman"><span class="s1">Expand existing links to mitigate the congestion and serve the demand. Evaluate the flow pattern and network performance using predictions generated by the ADAM simulator. (</span><i>Hints: It is the common practice to start from the most congested link. However, this will not guarantee the best result when you try to expand multiply links. So please try different combinations and show your finding in the report).</i></li>
  <li style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; font: 16.0px Times New Roman">Repeat step 2 and find the best investment strategy according to your criteria. You do not have to spend all the money but you do have to limit your spending within the budget.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; font: 16.0px Times New Roman">Finish your report and sent it to TA with the corresponding network file and the statistics file. Make sure you have clearly explained your objective, brief steps, final expansion choices, and the justifications, which should be less than two pages. Grading will be based on the overall quality of your report, which should show a good understanding of the problem and a clear procedure (<span class="s2"><i>you do not have to test every possibility and pursue the marginal improvement of your investment combination</i></span>).</li>
